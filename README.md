# Excel-Challenge
Regarding the Excel spreadsheet:
  Tab "Crowdfunding Original Dataset" - this is the original dataset, I always make a copy before working with data. 
  Tab "Work" - this is the copy of the original dataset, this is where I did the majority of the work for the challenge.
  The remaining tabs say exactly what part of the challenge is addressed.
